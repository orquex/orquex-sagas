= SAGA Framework

SAGA (Software Automation, Generation, and Administration) is a known pattern to manage long-live transactions in distributed environments.
Long Live Transactions (LLT), is a transaction that takes significant time to be completed and requires synchronization between multiple transactions.

When working in a distributed system, in most cases it is necessary to maintain a transactionality during the execution of a defined process, maintaining the properties of an ACID transaction (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability), to ensure that the processed and generated data are valid, however, the Saga pattern does not have the property of isolation, which can generate interference between different processes or transactions; A solution to this problem was solved by https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/enhancing-saga-pattern-distributed-transactions/docview/2679673542/se-2["Daraghmi, E. et al. (2022)"]
with the proposed quota cache mechanism and commit-sync service.

This project aims to define a way to implement this microservices pattern by specifying a structure that solves surrounding problems during the implementation and integration of a distributed system using this pattern.
The problems that are solved in this project are: definition of a domain for the creation of a flow, definition of the implementation and integration interfaces, and in addition to the main behaviour of the pattern, its compensation, two new mechanisms are integrated, preprocessing and post-processing that solve the integration problem when contracts or communication interfaces are unknown, thus allowing to extend it to any type of implementation.

The implementation is currently developed in Java, and is expected to be extended to other programming languages in the future.

== Documentation

For the Saga pattern implementation, there are 2 options, orchestration or choreography, with the orchestration all the execution works in the same machine that received the request, but with choreography, the execution of one transaction is distributed between all deployed engines.

=== Orchestration

image:./docs/assets/orchestration.png[Orchestration]

The _Executor_ of the *_Sagas Engine_* should be any system that exposes some interfaces that serve as triggers.

The *_Sagas Engine_* to start an execution will receive a Flow ID, Metadata, and a Payload, with the ID, can obtain a Flow, which determines the activities and evaluations to be sequentially executed.

Every compensation of an Activity will be added to a stack data structure to be executed in LIFO order.

=== Choreography

image:./docs/assets/choreography.png[Choreography]

In the choreography scenario, the flow execution is distributed using a message broker; once the Sagas Engine obtains the Flow, it will publish the first Step with additional information into the queue, and another instance of the Sagas Engine will be in charge of executing it and putting the next consecutive step in the queue.

____
This implementation uses the Saga Engine as a coordinator, to re-use the different Stages in multiple Flows.
