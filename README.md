# OrqueX SAGA Framework

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/orquex/orquex-sagas)

## ðŸš€ Build Bulletproof Distributed Workflows

OrqueX SAGA is a modern, developer-friendly framework for building resilient distributed workflows that just work.
Whether you're processing payments, managing orders, or orchestrating complex business processes across microservices,
SAGA handles the hard parts so you can focus on your business logic.

### Why SAGA?

**Distributed systems are hard.** When your workflow spans multiple services, databases, or APIs, things can (and will)
go wrong:

- Services crash mid-transaction
- Network calls timeout
- Partial failures leave your system in inconsistent states
- Rolling back distributed changes becomes a nightmare

**SAGA solves these problems** by providing:

- âœ… **Automatic compensation** - Failed operations are automatically rolled back
- âœ… **Resume from failure** - Workflows continue exactly where they left off after crashes
- âœ… **Visual workflow definition** - Define complex flows with simple JSON/YAML
- âœ… **Built-in resilience** - Retries, circuit breakers, and timeouts out of the box
- âœ… **Zero learning curve** - Works with your existing Java/Spring applications

### Real-World Example

```json
{
  "id": "order-processing",
  "stages": {
    "payment": {
      "id": "payment",
      "type": "activity",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "task": "charge-credit-card"
        }
      ],
      "outgoing": "inventory"
    },
    "inventory": {
      "id": "inventory",
      "type": "activity",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "task": "reserve-items"
        }
      ],
      "outgoing": "shipping"
    },
    "shipping": {
      "id": "shipping",
      "type": "activity",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "task": "create-shipment"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If payment succeeds but inventory fails, SAGA automatically:

1. ðŸ”„ Refunds the credit card charge
2. ðŸ“Š Logs the failure with full context
3. ðŸŽ¯ Allows you to retry from the inventory step

### What Makes OrqueX Different?

OrqueX SAGA is built for **real production workloads** with enterprise-grade features:

- **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested resilience patterns (retry, circuit breaker, timeouts)
- **Developer Experience**: Rich Spring Boot integration, clear error messages, debugging tools
- **Flexible Integration**: Works with REST APIs, databases, message queues, or custom logic
- **Preprocessing & Postprocessing**: Transform data between services without changing existing APIs
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for custom tasks and integrations

This framework extends the traditional SAGA pattern with practical features that solve real integration challenges in
distributed systems.

## Metadata and Payload

### Metadata

The metadata is a dictionary or map that contains additional information for a flow, stage, or task, and is shared
throughout the execution stack. Metadata provides contextual information that can influence execution behavior,
configuration, and decision-making during workflow processing.

#### Metadata Flow

Metadata flows through the execution hierarchy and gets merged at each level:

```
Execution Request â†’ Flow â†’ Stage â†’ Activity Task â†’ Task
```

#### Metadata Merging Strategy

During execution, metadata is merged using the following priority (highest to lowest):

1. **Stage Metadata** - Specific to the current stage being executed
2. **Flow Metadata** - Global metadata defined at the flow level
3. **Request Metadata** - Initial metadata provided in the execution request

#### Common Metadata Use Cases

- **Configuration Parameters**: Dynamic configuration values for tasks
- **Security Context**: Authentication tokens, user permissions, tenant information
- **Tracing Information**: Correlation IDs, trace spans, debugging flags
- **Business Context**: Customer information, environment settings, feature flags
- **Execution Hints**: Retry policies, timeout overrides, priority levels

### Payload

The payload represents the actual business data being processed through the workflow. Unlike metadata (which provides
context), payload contains the core information that stages operate on and transform during execution.

#### Payload Flow

The payload flows sequentially through the workflow stages in a chain-like manner. Each stage receives the payload from
the previous stage, processes it, and produces an output payload that becomes the input for the next stage. Payloads are
**not shared** between stages; instead, they are **transformed** and **passed forward**:

```
Initial Payload â†’ Stage 1 (process) â†’ Output Payload A â†’ Stage 2 (process) â†’ Output Payload B â†’ Stage 3 â†’ Final Result
```

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Sequential Processing**: Each stage operates on the output of the previous stage
- **Transformation Chain**: The response/output of one stage becomes the request/input of the next
- **Isolated Processing**: Stages don't have access to the original payload or outputs from non-adjacent stages
- **Linear Flow**: Data flows in one direction through the workflow pipeline

#### Payload Transformation

- Each stage can **read** the incoming payload
- Each stage can **modify** or **transform** the payload
- The output payload becomes the input for the next stage
- The final payload is returned as the workflow result

#### Payload vs Metadata

| Aspect             | Payload                          | Metadata                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | Business data being processed    | Contextual information and configuration |
| **Transformation** | Modified by each stage           | Merged and inherited                     |
| **Scope**          | Core workflow data               | Supporting information                   |
| **Usage**          | Primary input/output of stages   | Configuration and context                |
| **Persistence**    | Stored in checkpoints for resume | Stored in checkpoints for resume         |

#### Payload in Checkpoints

When resume-from-failure is enabled, both payload and metadata are stored in checkpoints:

- **Current payload state** is preserved for recovery
- **Metadata context** is maintained across restarts
- **Stage-specific transformations** can be resumed from the exact point of failure

#### Best Practices

**Payload:**

- Keep payload focused on business data
- Ensure payload is serializable for checkpoint storage
- Document expected payload structure for each stage
- Validate payload structure at stage boundaries

**Metadata:**

- Use metadata for configuration and context, not business data
- Prefer standard metadata keys across workflows
- Keep metadata lightweight and focused
- Document metadata requirements for reusable stages
